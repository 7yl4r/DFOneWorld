#A reddit post from the view of the adventurer Serena Autumnapples about the fortress of Fireanvils

Journal of Serena Autumnapples - Malachite 112

The dwarves never cease to amaze me with their ingenuity. Upon arriving at the fortress with my entourage of performers, I found them in the process of capping over the mouth of a volcano by casting a layer of obsidian. They have erected a smooth wall around the perimeter of their fortress - although there really is no need, we haven't had an invasion in this area in anyone's memory, or I wouldn't have left the forest retreat to seek adventure in the first place - and crafted smooth rooms and extensive facilities. They even have a special room, adorned with statues of dwarven heroes, for their children to play amongst puppies and war dogs. I can only imagine how much of a fit the elders would throw if they saw the giant stockpile of logs, though. I'd probably get a lecture about "how dare you admire those tree-cutting heathens" again. Whatever. It's not like I care about their stupid traditions.

All the military commanders were impressed by the performance I gave on the enara, and a couple dwarves in their militia even offered to join my troupe of traveling entertainers. The group of swordsdwarves regaled me of their most recent battle, a months-long arduous affair against a most dangerous beast. I expected it to be an ettin, or some wandering tundra titan, or perhaps a grotesque, long-forgotten beast. But it was not that, though I was warned away from the caverns on pain of being burnt alive by a being of fire locked within. The enemy in this battle, that had ended only shortly before I arrived, was... a strand of alpaca head wool. This made me grow suspicious, especially when he told of how the fort ground to a standstill as all but a select few dwarves became preoccupied with being the one to kill the animated wool strand, and those unaffected reduced to providing the fighters with food and water. Something in their tale just does not sit right.

I believe I have chanced upon the answer to my conundrum. While in the library the other day, I noticed a curious book, which was titled Strange Immortality. I know that since I do not grow old, I can never truly understand the mortal races' terror and fascination with aging and death. The book now sits in front of me, and I can tell from its newness that it is merely a copy of the original. Rumor has it that the dwarf who wrote it, Indiana Something-or-other, stole the secret of necromancy from a tower and now wishes to spread it across the world. I do not believe that is wise, for the undead are opposed to life and will destroy and consume all who do not join their cause.

.,.,.,

I have clad myself in the dwarves' spare armor, in case another such corpse "mysteriously" shows up while I am here. One day, I will prove myself worthy of wearing the dwarven steel, like in the legends of King Cacame. No enemies have emerged for me to fight yet; not even bandits roam these forests. Perhaps the necromancers are like me, bored of their peaceful life in the rich and fruitful region.

I cannot stay much longer under their dwarven hospitality. Perhaps I shall throw away the cursed book before I go. Or perhaps I am just overstepping my boundaries by trying to deny the dwarves the same privilege of immortality that my own race possesses by virtue of birth.

It's something I enjoy having, after all, even if I often become frustrated that everyone being immortal means our society never makes any progress.

Perhaps, I shall even take one of the dwarves' axes as I leave, to chop trees with. It's such a pain to travel with companions who can't swim.
