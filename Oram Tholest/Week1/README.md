Week 1 was played by /u/bchill23, who introduced the first player fortress to the world, Metalvault.

#Reddit post outlining the story and events of Metalvault:

"Many years ago, the dwarf Vabok Wallmoistened, a member of the Oily Boards began conducting strange and cultish experiments. She sacrificed her soul in search of immortality and created the tower of Mistrazors. Vabok became a necromancer and seduced a human prince from the Empire of Grey, Akan Cleancaughtto join her in the year 86. Akan became a necromancer as well and over time the two of them recruited others to join their twisted ways. At this time, our people, the Oily Boards were prospering and our King, Kadol Syrupgriffons, had ruled fairly for almost 70 years. But, power leads to corruption, and in the year 88 Kadol met Akan Cleanncaughtto. Kadol was seduced by a promise of greater power and left his kingdom to settle at the Tower of Mistrazors. In the coming years, Kadol's betrayal would ring out across the land. The Oily Boards lost their king and with him, their honor. In the year 100, Dakost Soothwall, queen of the Oily Board, created a plan to bring honor back to her homeland. Dakost sent forth her seven bravest subjects on an expedition to create a stronghold just steps from Mistrazors.

Their mission is to train and outfit the fighters needed to launch an all-out expedition to destroy Mistrazors and kill the former king and his necromantic friends. They must dig deep for legendary metals, constantly maintain a low profile on the surface, and train a massive force of dwarfs to form the strike squad.

After arriving in the barren wasteland, we began to dig deep to get under the cover of the earth. After breaching the first cavern it was clear that Armok was with us. There was a magma tube reaching all the way up to the cavern, just a few levels from the surface. We quickly set out building a bridge over the magma with the main fortress stretching out on the other side. We have traded with the elves, dwarfs and human over the past two seasons and continue to build up our fortress.

Late in the second year, Kogan, a massive beast made of fire, came to the fortress. After burning much of the cavern, the militia was sent out to deal with the creature. He set them on fire, before running down to the fort. The order had been given to close the gate but we were too busy drinking. While standing on the bridge he charged at a cheesemaker. The cheesy recruit dodged out of the beast’s attack and fell into the magma. The beast charged after him and fell in too. The beast swam around trying to climb his way out while throwing fireballs everywhere. In a stroke of brilliance, the recently elected, Mayor Uvash walked to the bridge, and calmly poured a bucket of water on the beast. The beast was stunned and slowly began to sink deeper and deeper down to the magma sea.

We have begun to turn raw adamantine into wafers to make armor for the newly reformed militia. The magma moat is finished and the dwarves are starting to turn out finer goods. The necromancer’s horde has been sighted only once as they passed over the land above us.

So far, praise to Armok, we remain undetected.

#And a comment detailing things that might be important for future players:

"Considerations for future playing:

It was my hope that the fort will continue for a while as the militia is trained and gains better gear, but that eventually, a player would use adventure mode to take some of the military and raid the tower.

There are many direct relatives of the necromancer, the former King Kadol Syrupgriffons, in the fortress. Are they supporters of the current rulers mission or spies from the tower with designs on becoming necromancers?

The forgotten beast is injured but still swimming in the magma sea. He may come out and attack once more.

The bridges that are connected have been linked to levers in the dining room. The levers are all labeled using [N].

The human caravan decided to depart just as the forgotten beast got to the surface, they were exiting the map just before they were engulfed in flame. I am not sure if this will cause a siege on not because,

well,

I mean,

I only saw them catch on fire,

they just left after that"
