Week 2 was played by /u/SMEXY_PENGUIN, who created the fortresses of Tekkudfesh and Risenbatok

#Reddit post detailing the events of the fortresses of Tekkudfesh and Risenbatok

24th of Opal, 101. It has been two weeks since the deep rumbling of Kogan shook Oram Tholest, and covered the land in a thick haze of ash. Many brave adventurers have traveled to Metalvault, none have returned. The fall of Metalvault marked a new age for Oram Tholest. The Age of Ambition. Many travelers would set out in the years to come. Some seeking their fame. Some seeking to create refuges for the unfairly treated. Others were simply sick of their lives, as was the cause for the seven dwarves who loaded up a wagon with everything a dwarf could want and set course for the scarlet hill.

11th of Obsidian, 101 The seed of a great fortress has been planted, and now the sapling must be nurtured. We have struck the earth, the first step in a great journey.

1st of Granite, 102 Everything is going to plan. We have a few workshops set up, producing some simple goods. We have hauled all our resources indoors and made a common room for idling dwarves.

2nd of Slate, 102 The above ground work-site was finished today, moat and all. The tunnel to the fortress has had some good progress to. We hope for migrants soon, and in abundance. We lack physical labor.

6th of Slate, 102 We hit the caverns today. Our endless tunnel into the earth has come to an end, and we can finally begin constructions. The plans are being made as I write this.

24th of Slate, 102 Zaneg Melbillbad, our woodworker was found dead. He had his arm stuck under a rock, and clearly died of dehydrated. It appears he was attempting to amputate his arm with another rock, but it didn’t work. Zaneg’s husband, Id Amkeskal didn’t take her death very well. We are worried for him.

1st of Hematite, 102 It is now summer. We are expecting migrants any time now. The sooner the better. We don’t have enough dwarves to run basic facilities. Id is still grieving.

7th of Malachite, 102 A dwarven family has arrived, both fit for the field. Not the thousand master craftsman dwarves we had hoped for, but a helping hand none the less. We’ll put them to work.

15th of Malachite, 102 Id has been found dead, dehydrated. Just like Zaneg. We have no time to mourn. Our reserves are running low; we need to hold out until more migrants arrive.

1st of Limestone, 102 Autumn has come. Still no migrants.

17th of Limestone, 102 Finally! Migrants have arrived. This is but one more step in the right direction for our fortress. We will begin cavern exploration soon... Who knows what’s down there….

2nd of Sandstone, 102 Ineth has had a miscarriage. She is in anguish, and refuses to work. Our community is falling apart.

8th of Sandstone, 102 Feb Thikutsobir has passed away, due to lack of water. Our numbers are dwindling.

15th of Sandstone, 102 Onget Stonducim has also left us. Lack of water. We are making a last ditch attempt to get a distillery up and going, before we all perish.

16th of Sandstone, 102 On the 15th Edem died. I didn’t bother making an entry. Today, Udil took over as our leader. There hasn’t been a smile in this damned cave in month. Momuz was also found dead today. Not a note of importance, at this stage.

21st of Sandstone, 102 Sakzul died. He was a child. Amarok has forsaken us.

24th of Sandstone, 102 Our last hope is for a band of migrants to come here, and rescue us. That is not very likely though. There are seven of us left, only two capable of leaving. The rest of us don’t have enough energy to climb the stairs to the surface, or make the icy trek to the nearest civilization. We are truly alone.

25 sandstone Zon cudistbomrek haz deaded. I start riting. Five of us left.

26 sandstone We are pushing for the caverns. We hope for water in they caverns.

27 sandstone foor of us left

5th of Timber, 102 Previous diary owners have both died. I have taken over. The store room smells of rotting corpses, and the depths of the earth threaten to take us away in our sleep. We are making a final push to the caverns, and praying that there is water in there.

12th of Timber, 102 The halls smell of death. The cavern creatures are not far off. I can hear them. I’ve barricaded myself in the dormitory. This is the last entry in this diary. A wooden bed leaned against a door isn’t much protection against the horrors of the depths. I hear them. Up the stairs. Through the common room. Along the hallway. At the door.

Fort 2: Risenbatok

Today is the 10th of obsidian, year 103. There are 6 of us left at Risenbatok fortress. Our leader is dead and sealed away safely in his tomb. The rest of us, are not as lucky. There are several corpses simply rotting on the ground. The burial room is full, not a single empty coffin. Minkot hasn’t moved for a few weeks, we think he is infected. Who knows though, we all could be infected. It hits randomly, every now and then. We lose a few people, and it goes away for a while before returning to haunt us all over again. The victims seem to turn into lizard creatures, and then they look for blood. Usually we overpower them before they have their way with their victim, but it’s too late. A single claw breaches your skin and you’re doomed. We were doing so well… We had a functioning iron industry up, and the next lot of traders is due in three days. We’ve shut the drawbridge though. Can’t have this curse spreading to the rest of the world, can we. I can hear the crying of Dodok and Bembul. They are but children. So is Kel, but he hasn’t moved for a while. Or not, He is up. His eyes are orange, and his skin is covered in scales. The children are no more. Lokum and I managed to kill it. Both of us are bleeding. All three of us are infected. Who knows when we will turn? Who cares? We have been forsaken by Amarok.
