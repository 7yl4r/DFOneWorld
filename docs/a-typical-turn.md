Hypothetical walkthrough of what a typical turn is like:

1. schedule a time to be the primary player
2. download the latest savefile
3. "check in" once you're in-game to ensure backup players don't get your points
    * within 24hrs of your scheduled time
3. dwarf around, make notes, take screenshots, and/or record video
4. upload save file to ...
5. upload historical documents to:
    1. text only: ...
    2. screenshots (+text): ...
    3. videos : ...
6. post to /r/dfoneworld 

---------------

thinking through how to automate user actions:

1. view & edit public schedule
    1. spreadsheet + google form? 
    2. youcanbook.me ? 
    3. doodle?
2. find latest savefile
    1. link updated via...?
3. upload new latest savefile
    1. dffd
4. "check in" to scheduled session
    1. ?
5. upload historical documents : done manually
6. create /r/dfoneworld post : done manually
7. browse chain/tree of historical documents & savefiles
    1. ?

Maybe there needs to be a "submit block" form with:
    1. historical doc links (separated by text, images, video)
    2. /r/dfoneworld post link
    3. dffd savefile link
    
 From the form results we can then fill 2 and 7 as well as automate scoring.
