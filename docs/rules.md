DFOneWorld history is broken into "blocks" of two weeks (real world time).

You may branch off and start playing at any point, 
but only the highest-scored branch becomes part of the official history.

Here are some tips to ensure your branch gets accepted into the historybooks:

1. communicate to reduce competition for history blocks
    1. the scheduled player gets 20 points, backup players must be documented in advance
2. document your play actions
    1. written history +10
    2. screenshots +5
    3. video/stream +5
3. higher voted submissions on `/r/dfoneworld` are given points as ranked in "top->past week"
    1. 10 points for 1st
    2. 6  points for 2nd
    3. 3  points for 3rd
    
*NOTE*: point values above are subject to change significantly or be disregarded entirely.
