# DFOneWorld
A community project to maintain a persistent Dwarf Fortress world.

The goal of this project is to, as a community, build up a persistent world for ourselves and posterity to explore.
Each week three participants will build a fortress on the map, at any location they like. Then, of those three, the community will vote to select a single fortress's world file to continue the chain.  This will continue indefinitely, and records of the fortresses and their creators will be compiled here.
